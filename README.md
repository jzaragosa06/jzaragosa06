### üëã Hi there! I'm Jun

I am an information technology student major in web and mobile technologies development. I also have a strong passion in data analysis and data science. Among my notable projects in data analysis is an [automated time series forecasting](https://medium.com/@junjunzaragosa2309/using-large-language-model-to-provide-context-specific-explanation-to-time-series-forecast-69a701abb40a), which incorporates LLM to provide context-specific explanations for the results and built using the Laravel framework. In data science, my notable project includes a [sentiment analyzer](https://medium.com/@junjunzaragosa2309/sentiment-analyzer-natural-language-processing-web-application-fa0ea89f5825), a web application built using Streamlit framework. I have a strong understanding of the fundamentals of `C++`, `Java`, and `Java`. I use `Python` extensibly to work on data projects. More importantly, I am committed to making meaningful contributions to our world.

üî≠ I'm currently working on:
- Improved version of Automated time series forecasting
    - Forecast on either univariate or multivariate time series data.
    - Analyze time series data in terms of its trend and seasonality patterns.
    - Add a collaborative feature to allow different users to work on the same forecasting project. 


üßë‚Äçüî¨ I am also a [DOST Scholar](https://www.dost.gov.ph/transparency/about-dost/desired-outcomes/23-announcements/3558-scholarship-announcement.html). I took satisfaction in creating softwares that have science-related applications. 

I'm always looking to collaborate on exciting projects and ideas, so please feel free to reach out over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jun-jun-zaragosa-b585992a1/) or email me at [junjunzaragosa2309@gmail.com](junjunzaragosa2309@gmail.com)
